# Your Sphere - Development History

## Overview
This document outlines the development journey of Your Sphere, a location-based social media application. It chronicles the evolution from initial concept to current implementation, highlighting key decisions, challenges, and methodologies employed throughout the development process.

## Phase 1: UI Prototyping (Weeks 1-2)

### Initial Mockup Development
- Created static UI components using React and Material-UI
- Focused on visual design and user experience
- Implemented core components:
  - Navigation bars (top and bottom)
  - Post feed layout
  - Basic post structure
  - Map integration with Leaflet

### Methodology
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed for mobile devices first, then adapted for larger screens
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Built reusable UI components
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly iterated on design concepts
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on intuitive navigation and clear visual hierarchy

## Phase 2: Data Structure & Mock Backend (Weeks 3-4)

### Post Infrastructure
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for post data
- Implemented mock data structure
- Created post creation and display components
- Added location handling with coordinates

### Mock Backend Implementation
- Set up local data management
- Created mock API endpoints
- Implemented basic CRUD operations
- Added image handling simulation

### Methodology
- **Data-First Development**: Defined data structures before implementation
- **Type Safety**: Used TypeScript for robust data handling
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separated UI from data management
- **Incremental Testing**: Tested each component as it was built

## Phase 3: Backend Development (Weeks 5-6)

### Server Implementation
- Set up Node.js/Express server
- Implemented MongoDB integration
- Created authentication system with JWT
- Added file upload handling with Multer

### API Development
- Designed RESTful endpoints
- Implemented user authentication
- Added post creation and retrieval
- Set up image storage and retrieval

### Methodology
- **API-First Design**: Defined endpoints before implementation
- **Security-First**: Implemented authentication early
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for future growth
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## Phase 4: Integration & Deployment (Weeks 7-8)

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- Connected React frontend to Express backend
- Implemented authentication flow
- Added real-time data updates
- Integrated file upload system

### Deployment Process
- Set up GitHub repository
- Configured Netlify for frontend hosting
- Deployed backend to Render
- Set up MongoDB Atlas for database hosting

### Methodology
- **Continuous Integration**: Regular code commits and testing
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate settings for development and production
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Added features incrementally
- **Performance Optimization**: Focused on loading times and responsiveness

## Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)

### Feature Enhancement
- Improved map functionality
- Enhanced image handling
- Added location persistence
- Implemented default location handling

### Performance Optimization
- Optimized image loading
- Improved map rendering
- Enhanced state management
- Added error boundaries

### Methodology
- **User Feedback**: Incorporated user testing results
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracked and improved load times
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved code quality and maintainability
- **Documentation**: Enhanced code and user documentation
